This is where I explore APIs and API test automation with [Postman](https://www.postman.com) by testing [https://apichallenges.eviltester.com/gui/challenges/](https://apichallenges.eviltester.com/gui/challenges/) API.

Import [collection file](postman/collections/API-challenger-collection.json) and [environment file](Challenger.postman_environment.json) to [Postman application](https://www.postman.com) to see API requests and tests.
